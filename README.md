### The Tests

2.

> Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and
> ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

3.
> Write a test that ensures the menu element is
> hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and
> the CSS to determine how we're performing the
> hidingshowing of the menu element.

4.
> Write a new test suite named "The menu"
> Write a test that ensures the menu changes
> visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test
> should have two expectations: does the menu display when
> clicked and does it hide when clicked again.

5.
> Write a new test suite named "Initial Entries"

6.
> Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed
> function is called and completes its work, there is at least
> a single .entry element within the .feed container.

7.
> Write a new test suite named "New Feed Selection"

8.
> Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded
> by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
